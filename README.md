# Bank-Customer-Churn-Predict

This project is focused on predicting customer churn by analyzing key features from the dataset. It utilizes a machine learning pipeline integrating the XGBoost algorithm, SMOTE to handle class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. The model is evaluated using the F1 Score, achieving a 60% threshold for churn customers to ensure balanced predictions. The results of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the churn prediction model are deployed using Hugging Face, providing an efficient solution to identify at-risk customers.
